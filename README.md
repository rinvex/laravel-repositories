💡 If you are looking for **Laravel 5.5** support, use the `dev-develop` branch. It's stable but not tagged yet since test suites isn't complete. 💡


⚠️ [This package is looking for new maintainer, read details or takeover if interested!](https://github.com/rinvex/laravel-repositories/issues/156) ⚠️


## Features

- Cache, Cache, Cache!
- Prevent code duplication.
- Reduce potential programming errors.
- Granularly cache queries with flexible control.
- Apply centrally managed, consistent access rules and logic.
- Implement and centralize a caching strategy for the domain model.
- Improve the code’s maintainability and readability by separating client objects from domain models.
- Maximize the amount of code that can be tested with automation and to isolate both the client object and the domain model to support unit testing.
- Associate a behavior with the related data. For example, calculate fields or enforce complex relationships or business rules between the data elements within an entity.


## Quick Example (TL;DR)

The `Rinvex\Repository\Repositories\BaseRepository` is an abstract class with bare minimum that concrete implementations must extend.

The `Rinvex\Repository\Repositories\EloquentRepository` is currently the only available repository implementation (more to come in the future and [you can develop your own](#add-custom-implementation)), it makes it easy to create new eloquent model instances and to manipulate them easily. To use `EloquentRepository` your repository MUST extend it first:

```php
namespace App\Repositories;

use Rinvex\Repository\Repositories\EloquentRepository;

class FooRepository extends EloquentRepository
{
    protected $repositoryId = 'rinvex.repository.uniqueid';

    protected $model = 'App\Models\User';
}
```
That's it, you're done! Yes, it's that simple.

But if you'd like more control over the container instance, or would like to pass model name dynamically you can alternatively do as follow:

```php
namespace App\Repositories;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container;
use Rinvex\Repository\Repositories\EloquentRepository;

class FooRepository extends EloquentRepository
{
    // Instantiate repository object with required data
    public function __construct(Container $container)
    {
        $this->setContainer($container)
             ->setModel(\App\Models\User::class)
             ->setRepositoryId('rinvex.repository.uniqueid');

    }
}
```

Now inside your controller, you can either instantiate the repository traditionally through `$repository = new \App\Repositories\FooRepository();` or to use Laravel's awesome dependency injection and let the IoC do the magic:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Repositories\FooRepository;

class BarController
{
    // Inject `FooRepository` from the IoC
    public function baz(FooRepository $repository)
    {
        // Find entity by primary key
        $repository->find(1);

        // Find all entities
        $repository->findAll();

        // Create a new entity
        $repository->create(['name' => 'Example']);
    }
}
```

## Installation

The best and easiest way to install this package is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

### Compatibility

This package fully compatible with **Laravel** `5.1.*`, `5.2.*`, and `5.3.*`.

While this package tends to be framework-agnostic, it embraces Laravel culture and best practices to some extent. It's tested mainly with Laravel but you still can use it with other frameworks or even without any framework if you want.

### Require Package

Open your application's `composer.json` file and add the following line to the `require` array:
```json
"rinvex/laravel-repositories": "3.0.*"
```

> **Note:** Make sure that after the required changes your `composer.json` file is valid by running `composer validate`.

### Install Dependencies

On your terminal run `composer install` or `composer update` command according to your application's status to install the new requirements.

> **Note:** Checkout Composer's [Basic Usage](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) documentation for further details.


## Integration

**Rinvex Repository** package is framework-agnostic and as such can be integrated easily natively or with your favorite framework.

### Native Integration

Integrating the package outside of a framework is incredibly easy, just require the `vendor/autoload.php` file to autoload the package.

> **Note:** Checkout Composer's [Autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) documentation for further details.

Run the following command on your terminal to publish config files:
```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="rinvex-repository-config"
```

> **Note:** Checkout Laravel's [Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/master/#configuration) documentation for further details.

You are good to go. Integration is done and you can now use all the available methods, proceed to the [Usage](#usage) section for an example.


## Configuration

If you followed the previous integration steps, then your published config file reside at `config/rinvex.repository.php`.

Config options are very expressive and self explanatory, as follows:

```php
return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Models Directory
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may specify the default models directory, just write
    | directory name, like 'Models' not the full path.
    |
    | Default: 'Models'
    |
    */

    'models' => 'Models',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Caching Strategy
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */

    'cache' => [

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Cache Keys File
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | Here you may specify the cache keys file that is used only with cache
        | drivers that does not support cache tags. It is mandatory to keep
        | track of cache keys for later usage on cache flush process.
        |
        | Default: storage_path('framework/cache/rinvex.repository.json')
        |
        */

        'keys_file' => storage_path('framework/cache/rinvex.repository.json'),

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Cache Lifetime
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | Here you may specify the number of seconds that you wish the cache
        | to be remembered before it expires. If you want the cache to be
        | remembered forever, set this option to -1. 0 means disabled.
        |
        | Default: -1
        |
        */

        'lifetime' => -1,

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Cache Clear
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | Specify which actions would you like to clear cache upon success.
        | All repository cached data will be cleared accordingly.
        |
        | Default: ['create', 'update', 'delete']
        |
        */

        'clear_on' => [
            'create',
            'update',
            'delete',
        ],

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Cache Skipping URI
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | For testing purposes, or maybe some certain situations, you may wish
        | to skip caching layer and get fresh data result set just for the
        | current request. This option allows you to specify custom
        | URL parameter for skipping caching layer easily.
        |
        | Default: 'skipCache'
        |
        */

        'skip_uri' => 'skipCache',

    ],

];
```

// Determine if repository cache clear is enabled
$cacheClearStatus = $repository->isCacheClearEnabled();
```

#### `createModel()`

The `createModel()` method creates a new repository model instance:

```php
$repositoryModelInstance = $repository->createModel();
```

#### `forgetCache()`

The `forgetCache()` method forgets the repository cache:

The `where` method adds a basic where clause to the query:

```php
$repository->where('slug', '=', 'example');
```

#### `whereIn()`

The `whereIn` method adds a "where in" clause to the query:

```php
$repository->whereIn('id', [1, 2, 5, 8]);
```

#### `whereNotIn()`

The `whereNotIn` method adds a "where not in" clause to the query:

```php
$repository->whereNotIn('id', [1, 2, 5, 8]);
```

#### `whereHas()`

The `whereHas` method adds a "where has relationship" clause to the query:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

$repository->whereHas('attachments', function (Builder $builder) use ($attachment) {
    $builder->where('attachment_id', $attachment->id);
});
```

> **Note:** All of the `where*` methods are chainable & could be called multiple times in a single request. It will hold all where clauses in an array internally and apply them all before executing the query.

#### `offset()`

The `offset` method sets the "offset" value of the query:

```php
$repository->offset(5);
```

#### `limit()`

The `limit` method sets the "limit" value of the query:

```php
$repository->limit(9);
```

#### `orderBy()`

The `orderBy` method adds an "order by" clause to the query:

$repository->orderBy('id', 'asc');
```

#### `find()`

The `find` method finds an entity by it's primary key:

```php
$entity = $repository->find(1);
```

#### `findOrFail()`

The `findOrFail()` method finds an entity by its primary key or throw an exception:

```php
$entity = $repository->findOrFail(1);
```

#### `findOrNew()`

The `findOrNew()` method finds an entity by its primary key or return fresh entity instance:

```php
$entity = $repository->findOrNew(1);
```

#### `findBy()`

$firstEntity = $repository->findFirst();
```

#### `findAll()`

The `findAll` method finds all entities:

```php
$allEntities = $repository->findAll();
```

#### `paginate()`

The `paginate` method paginates all entities:

```php
$entitiesPagination = $repository->paginate(15, ['*'], 'page', 2);
```
As you can guess, this query the first 15 records, in the second page.

#### `simplePaginate()`

The `simplePaginate` method paginates all entities into a simple paginator:

```php
$entitiesSimplePagination = $repository->simplePaginate(15);
```

#### `findWhere()`

The `findWhere` method finds all entities matching where conditions:

```php
// Matching values with equal '=' operator
$repository->findWhere(['slug', '=', 'example']);
```

#### `findWhereIn()`

$includedEntities = $repository->findwhereIn(['id', [1, 2, 5, 8]]);
```

#### `findWhereNotIn()`

The `findWhereNotIn` method finds all entities matching whereNotIn conditions:

```php
$excludedEntities = $repository->findWhereNotIn(['id', [1, 2, 5, 8]]);
```

#### `findWhereHas()`

The `findWhereHas` method finds all entities matching whereHas conditions:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

$entities = $repository->findWhereHas(['attachments', function (Builder $builder) use ($attachment) {
    $builder->where('attachment_id', $attachment->id);
}]);
```

> **Notes:**
> - The `findWhereHas` method will return a collection of entities that match the condition inside the closure. If you need to embed the `attachments` relation, in this case, you'll need to call `with()` method before calling `findWhereHas()` like this: `$repository->with('attachments')->findWhereHas([...]);`
> - Signature of all of the `findWhere`, `findWhereIn`, and `findWhereNotIn` methods has been changed since **v2.0.0**.
> - All of the `findWhere`, `findWhereIn`, and `findWhereNotIn` methods utilize the `where`, `whereIn`, and `whereNotIn` methods respectively, and thus takes first argument as an array of same parameters required by the later ones.
> - All of the `find*` methods are could be filtered with preceding `where` clauses, which is chainable by the way. All `where` clauses been hold in an array internally and applied before executing the query. Check the following examples:

Example of filtered `findAll` method:
```php
$allFilteredEntities = $repository->where('slug', '=', 'example')->findAll();
```

Another example of filtered `findFirst` method with chained clauses:
```php
$allFilteredEntities = $repository->where('name', 'LIKE', '%TEST%')->where('slug', '=', 'example')->findFirst();
```

#### `create()`

The `create` method creates a new entity with the given attributes:
```php
$createdEntity = $repository->create(['name' => 'Example']);
```

#### `update()`

The `update` method updates an entity with the given attributes:
```php
$updatedEntity = $repository->update(1, ['name' => 'Example2']);
```

#### `store()`

The `store` method stores the entity with the given attributes:
```php
// Existing Entity
$storedEntity = $repository->store(1, ['name' => 'Example2']);

// New Entity
$storedEntity = $repository->store(null, ['name' => 'Example2']);
```

> **Note:** This method is just an alias for both `create` & `update` methods. It's useful in case where single form is used for both create & update processes.

#### `delete()`

The `delete` method deletes an entity with the given id:
```php
$deletedEntity = $repository->delete(1);
```

#### `beginTransaction()`

The `beginTransaction` method starts a database transaction:
```php
$repository->beginTransaction();
```

#### `commit()`

The `commit` method commits a database transaction:
```php
$repository->commit();
```

#### `rollBack()`

The `rollback` method rollbacks a database transaction:
```php
$repository->rollBack();
```

> **Notes:**
> - All `find*` methods take one more optional parameter for selected attributes.
> - All `set*` methods returns an instance of the current repository, and thus can be chained.
> - `create`, `update`, and `delete` methods always return an array with two values, the first is action status whether it's success or fail as a boolean value, and the other is an instance of the model just operated upon.
> - It's recommended to set IoC container instance, repository model, and repository identifier explicitly through your repository constructor like the above example, but this package is smart enough to guess any missing requirements. [Check Automatic Guessing Section](#automatic-guessing)

### Code To An Interface

As a best practice, it's recommended to code for an interface, specifically for scalable projects. The following example explains how to do so.

First, create an interface (abstract) for every entity you've:
```php
use Rinvex\Repository\Contracts\CacheableContract;
use Rinvex\Repository\Contracts\RepositoryContract;

interface UserRepositoryContract extends RepositoryContract, CacheableContract
{
    //
}
```

Second, create a repository (concrete implementation) for every entity you've:
```php
use Rinvex\Repository\Repositories\EloquentRepository;

class UserEloquentRepository extends EloquentRepository implements UserRepositoryContract
{
    //
}
```

Now in a Laravel Service Provider bind both to the IoC (inside the `register` method):
```php
$this->app->bind(UserRepositoryContract::class, UserEloquentRepository::class)
```
This way we don't have to instantiate the repository manually, and it's easy to switch between multiple implementations. The IoC Container will take care of the required dependencies.

> **Note:** Checkout Laravel's [Service Providers](https://laravel.com/docs/master/providers) and [Service Container](https://laravel.com/docs/master/container) documentation for further details.

### Add Custom Implementation

Since we're focusing on abstracting the data layer, and we're separating the abstract interface from the concrete implementation, it's easy to add your own implementation.

Say your domain model uses a web service, or a filesystem data store as it's data source, all you need to do is just extend the `BaseRepository` class, that's it. See:
```php
class FilesystemRepository extends BaseRepository
{
    // Implement here all `RepositoryContract` methods that query/persist data to & from filesystem or whatever datastore
}
```

### EloquentRepository Fired Events

Repositories fire events at every action, like `create`, `update`, `delete`. All fired events are prefixed with repository's identifier (you set before in your [repository's constructor](#eloquentrepository)) like the following example:

- rinvex.repository.uniqueid.entity.created
- rinvex.repository.uniqueid.entity.updated
- rinvex.repository.uniqueid.entity.deleted

For your convenience, the events suffixed with `.entity.created`, `.entity.updated`, or `.entity.deleted` have listeners that take actions accordingly. Usually we need to flush cache -if enabled & exists- upon every success action.

There's one more event `rinvex.repository.uniqueid.entity.cache.flushed` that's fired on cache flush. It has no listeners by default, but you may need to listen to it if you've model relations for further actions.

### Mandatory Repository Conventions

Here some conventions important to know while using this package. This package adheres to best practices trying to make development easier for web artisans, and thus it has some conventions for standardization and interoperability.

- All Fired Events has a unique suffix, like `.entity.created` for example. Note the `.entity.` which is mandatory for automatic event listeners to subscribe to.

- Default directory structure of any package uses **Rinvex Repository** is as follows:
```
├── config                  --> config files
|
├── database
|   ├── factories           --> database factory files
|   ├── migrations          --> database migration files
|   └── seeds               --> database seed files
|
├── resources
|   └── lang
|       └── en              --> English language files

└── composer.json           --> composer dependencies file
```

> **Note:** **Rinvex Repository** adheres to [PSR-4: Autoloader](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) and expects other packages that uses it to adhere to the same standard as well. It's required for [Automatic Guessing](#automatic-guessing), such as when repository model is missing, it will be guessed automatically and resolved accordingly, and while that full directory structure might not required, it's the standard for all **Rinvex** packages.

### Automatic Guessing

While it's **recommended** to explicitly set IoC container, repository identifier, and repository model; This package is smart enough to guess any of these required data whenever missing.

- **IoC Container** `app()` helper is used as a fallback if IoC container instance not provided explicitly.
- **Repository Identifier** It's recommended to set repository identifier as a doted name like `rinvex.repository.uniqueid`, but if it's missing fully qualified repository class name will be used (actually the value of `static::class`).
- **Repository Model** Conventionally repositories are namespaced like this `Rinvex\Demos\Repositories\ItemRepository`, so corresponding model supposed to be namespaced like this `Rinvex\Demos\Models\Item`. That's how this packages guess the model if it's missing according to the [Default Directory Structure](#mandatory-repository-conventions).

### Flexible & Granular Caching

**Rinvex Repository** has a powerful, yet simple and granular caching system, that handles almost every edge case. While you can enable/disable your application's cache as a whole, you have the flexibility to enable/disable cache granularly for every individual query! That gives you the ability to except certain queries from being cached even if the method is normally cached by default or otherwise.

Let's see what caching levels we can control:

#### Whole Application Cache

Checkout Laravel's [Cache](https://laravel.com/docs/master/cache) documentation for more details.

#### Individual Query Cache

Change cache per query or disable it:
```php
// Set cache lifetime for this individual query to 123 seconds
$repository->setCacheLifetime(123);

// Set cache lifetime for this individual query to forever
$repository->setCacheLifetime(-1);

// Disable cache for this individual query
$repository->setCacheLifetime(0);
```

Change cache driver per query:
```php
// Set cache driver for this individual query to redis
$repository->setCacheDriver('redis');
```

Both `setCacheLifetime` & `setCacheDriver` methods are chainable:
```php
// Change cache lifetime & driver on runtime
$repository->setCacheLifetime(123)->setCacheDriver('redis')->findAll();

// Use default cache lifetime & driver
$repository->findAll();
```

Unless disabled explicitly, cache is enabled for all repositories by default, and kept for as long as your `rinvex.repository.cache.lifetime` config value, using default application's cache driver `cache.default` (which could be changed per query as well).

Caching results is totally up to you, while all retrieval `find*` methods have cache enabled by default, you can enable/disable cache for individual queries or control how it's being cached, for how long, and using which driver as you wish.

#### Temporary Skip Individual HTTP Request Cache

Lastly, you can skip cache for an individual request by passing the following query string in your URL `skipCache=true`. You can modify this parameter to whatever name you may need through the `rinvex.repository.cache.skip_uri` config option.


## Final Thoughts

- Since this is an evolving implementation that may change accordingly depending on real-world use cases.
- Repositories intelligently pass missing called methods to the underlying model, so you actually can implement any kind of logic, or even complex queries by utilizing the repository model.
- For more insights about the Active Repository implementation, I've published an article on the topic titled [Active Repository is good & Awesomely Usable](https://blog.omranic.com/active-repository-is-good-awesomely-usable-6991cfd58774), read it if you're interested.
- Repositories utilizes cache tags in a very smart way, even if your chosen cache driver doesn't support it. Repositories will manage it virtually on it's own for precise cache management. Behind scenes it uses a json file to store cache keys. Checkout the `rinvex.repository.cache.keys_file` config option to change file path.
- **Rinvex Repository** follows the FIG PHP Standards Recommendations compliant with the [PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-4: Autoloader](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.
- I don't see the benefit of adding a more complex layer by implementing the **Criteria Pattern** for filtration at the moment, rather I'd prefer to keep it as simple as it is now using traditional where clauses since we can achieve same results. (do you've different thoughts? explain please)
